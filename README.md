# SCANOSS Platform 2.0 Purl Helper Package
Welcome to the SCANOSS Platform 2.0 purl helper package.

This package contains helper functions to make development of Go gRPC services easier to configure for purl processing.

## Usage
There are a number of helper functions in this package. More details about each one can be found in the packaged documentation.

An example of one of the functions is `PurlNameFromString`. This function takes a Purl string as an input, parses that string and returns just the name of the Purl.
